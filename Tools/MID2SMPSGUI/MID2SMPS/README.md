# MID_2_SMPSASM_GUI
A frontend to speed up creating SMPS ASM files for SMPS2ASM

# INSTRUCTIONS
This program is just a front end - it does nothing by itself.
You will need to find Valleybell's MID2SMPS.exe, SMPSOpt.exe, and SMPS2ASM.exe on your own. place them inside the MID2SMPS folder, and then run the EXE file.

Click Run MID2SMPS to launch the MID2SMPS program, and use that to convert your MIDI song into an SMPS .bin file.
After you've made that file, choose the number of optimization steps to reduce the size of the final file (or choose 0 to skip optimization)
Click the "Convert SMPS Bin File" button under step 3, and an open file dialogue will appear. Select the .bin file you created, and an ASM music file should be automatically generated in the same folder as this EXE.
